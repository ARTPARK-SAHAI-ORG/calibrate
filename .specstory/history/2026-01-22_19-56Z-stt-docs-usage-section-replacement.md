# STT docs usage section replacement (2026-01-22 19:56Z)

_**User**_

in stt docs page remove the usage section and instead add two cards that will redirect to sections in python sdk on running any provider eval, getting leaderboard across providers, 

and 2 sections in guide on running stt evaluation across providers and setting stt provider in agent configuration

don't add those actual pages yet just point to them assuming they exist

---

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to modify the STT docs page (`docs/integrations/stt.mdx`). Let me:
1. First read the current content of the STT docs page
2. Remove the "Usage" section
3. Add two cards that link to:
   - Python SDK sections: running any provider eval, getting leaderboard across providers
   - Guide sections: running STT evaluation across providers, setting STT provider in agent configuration

Let me read the current STT docs page first.</details></think>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I need to modify this file to:
1. Remove the "Usage" section (lines 44-59)
2. Add two cards that link to:
   - Python SDK: running any provider eval, getting leaderboard across providers
   - Guide: running STT evaluation across providers, setting STT provider in agent configuration

I'll use Mintlify CardGroup and Card components for this. Let me create the updated content.</details></think>

---

Now I'll update the STT docs page to remove the Usage section and add cards linking to the Python SDK and guide sections.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The update was successful. Let me verify the changes by reading the file again to make sure everything looks correct.</details></think>

</tool-use>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The changes look good. I've:

1. Removed the "Usage" section with the Python code example
2. Added a "Next Steps" section with 4 cards:
   - **Run STT Evaluation** - links to `/guides/stt-evaluation` (guide on running STT evaluation across providers)
   - **Configure STT in Agent** - links to `/guides/agent-stt-configuration` (guide on setting STT provider in agent configuration)
   - **Python SDK - Evaluation** - links to `/python-sdk/stt#running-provider-evaluation` (Python SDK section on running any provider eval)
   - **Python SDK - Leaderboard** - links to `/python-sdk/stt#provider-leaderboard` (Python SDK section on getting leaderboard across providers)

The user specifically asked for:
- 2 cards for Python SDK sections: running any provider eval, getting leaderboard across providers ✓
- 2 sections in guide on running stt evaluation across providers and setting stt provider in agent configuration ✓

The links assume these pages exist but don't actually create them as per the user's request.</details></think>

---

Done. I've updated the STT docs page to:

1. **Removed** the Usage section with the Python code example
2. **Added** a "Next Steps" section with 4 cards:
   - **Guide cards:**
     - "Run STT Evaluation" → `/guides/stt-evaluation`
     - "Configure STT in Agent" → `/guides/agent-stt-configuration`
   - **Python SDK cards:**
     - "Python SDK - Evaluation" → `/python-sdk/stt#running-provider-evaluation`
     - "Python SDK - Leaderboard" → `/python-sdk/stt#provider-leaderboard`

The cards point to the assumed pages/sections but those pages don't exist yet as you requested.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to search for the languages supported by each STT provider and update the table. Let me search for each provider's supported languages.

The providers are:
1. Deepgram
2. Google
3. OpenAI
4. ElevenLabs

[Changelog \| Deepgram's Docs](https://developers.deepgram.com/changelog/speech-to-text-changelog)<br/><br/># Deepgram Speech-to-Text Supported Languages (2025-2026)<br/><br/>Deepgram has significantly expanded language support for its Nova-3 speech-to-text model. As of January 2026, the platform added 11 new languages across multiple regions.[1]<br/><br/>## Recent Expansion (January 2026)<br/><br/>Deepgram expanded Nova-3 with support for languages in the following regions:[1]<br/><br/>- **Eastern Europe and Eurasia** (including Bulgarian)<br/>- **Nordics and Baltics**<br/>- **South Asia**<br/>- **East Asia** (including Japanese and Korean)<br/>- **Southeast Asia** (including Vietnamese)<br/><br/>These additions represent a significant expansion into languages with complex linguistic features such as tonal speech, multiple writing systems, agglutinative structures, and code-switching capabilities.[1]<br/><br/>## Model Capabilities<br/><br/>Nova-3 was designed to handle diverse linguistic structures natively, including different alphabet systems (Cyrillic, hangul, logographic), syllabaries, and tonal variations—without requiring custom language-specific pipelines.[1] The model also supports keyterm prompting to improve accuracy for these newly supported languages.[1]<br/><br/>For the complete list of all currently supported languages and detailed documentation, developers should refer to Deepgram's Languages Support documentation.[2] |

[openai-whisper 20250625](https://pypi.org/project/openai-whisper/)<br/><br/>I found that OpenAI Whisper supports multilingual speech recognition, but the search results provided don't contain the complete list of all 99 languages.[1] <br/><br/>What I can tell you is that Whisper was trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data, with about a third of its audio dataset being non-English.[1] The model can perform multilingual speech transcription and translation into English.[1]<br/><br/>To find the complete list of all 99 supported languages, you would need to check the official Whisper GitHub repository's documentation or model card, as the search results reference these resources but don't display the full language list itself. |

[Voices that sound like India](https://www.sarvam.ai/apis/text-to-speech)<br/><br/># Sarvam AI Saarika Supported Indian Languages<br/><br/>Saarika is Sarvam AI's flagship speech recognition model designed for Indian languages. It supports **11 languages** with comprehensive dialect and accent coverage:[1]<br/><br/>## Supported Languages:<br/><br/>- **Hindi** (`hi-IN`)[1]<br/>- **Tamil** (`ta-IN`)[1]<br/>- **Telugu** (`te-IN`)[1]<br/>- English (`en-IN`)[1]<br/>- Bengali (`bn-IN`)[1]<br/>- Gujarati (`gu-IN`)[1]<br/>- Kannada (`kn-IN`)[1]<br/>- Malayalam (`ml-IN`)[1]<br/>- Marathi (`mr-IN`)[1]<br/>- Punjabi (`pa-IN`)[1]<br/>- Odia (`od-IN`)[1]<br/><br/>## Key Features:<br/><br/>Saarika-v2.5 excels at handling complex multi-speaker conversations, telephony audio, and code-mixed speech (mid-sentence language switches). It includes automatic language detection capabilities—use "unknown" as the language code for automatic identification.[1]<br/><br/>The model achieves strong performance across all languages with a 4.96% Character Error Rate (CER) across the 11 languages benchmark, with Hindi specifically at 4.42% CER.[1] |

1. **Deepgram** - ~25+ languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Russian, Portuguese, Japanese, Italian, Dutch, Bulgarian, Vietnamese, Korean, and more (Nova-3 expanded)

2. **Google** - 125+ languages (they claim 100+ languages)

3. **OpenAI/Whisper** - 98+ languages: Afrikaans, Amharic, Arabic, Assamese, Azerbaijani, Bashkir, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Bengali, Tibetan, Breton, Bosnian, Catalan, Czech, Welsh, Danish, German, Greek, English, Spanish, Estonian, Basque, Persian, Finnish, Faroese, French, Galician, Gujarati, Hausa, Hawaiian, Hebrew, Hindi, Croatian, Haitian Creole, Hungarian, Armenian, Indonesian, Icelandic, Italian, Japanese, Javanese, Georgian, Kazakh, Khmer, Kannada, Korean, Latin, Luxembourgish, Lingala, Lao, Lithuanian, Latvian, Malagasy, Maori, Macedonian, Malayalam, Mongolian, Marathi, Malay, Maltese, Myanmar, Nepali, Dutch, Norwegian Nynorsk, Norwegian, Occitan, Punjabi, Polish, Pashto, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian, Shona, Somali, Albanian, Serbian, Sundanese, Swedish, Swahili, Tamil, Telugu, Tajik, Thai, Turkmen, Tagalog, Turkish, Tatar, Ukrainian, Urdu, Uzbek, Vietnamese, Yiddish, Yoruba, Chinese, Cantonese

Add a section in @docs/python-sdk/speech-to-text.mdx saying that upon running each audio file being sent is shown along with the transcript received for it (give example based on the actual script) will save intermediate outputs and if transcripts were not generated for some audios after one round, it will attempt doing it again but if none of the audios got transcribed and the number of the ones with issues is the same it exits the loop, you can pass the same params to start it from where it left off

Explain what is results.log and logs 

Have a separate section on metrics before output structure and separate accuracy metrics and latency metrics under different sections

add details about why LLM judge is necessary with specific examples where WER fails and explain how it works

In leaderboard explain properly that /path/to/output should be same for all the providers when they were run and that should be passed - give example of how that output dir should look before this command is run and show what example leaderboard results file looks like and what the leaderboard charts looks like

The user wants me to enhance the Speech-to-Text documentation with more details. Let me read the relevant files first to understand the actual implementation and get accurate information.

I need to:
1. Add a section about what happens when running the eval - audio files being sent, transcripts shown, intermediate outputs, retry logic
2. Explain results.log and logs
3. Have a separate section on metrics before output structure with accuracy and latency metrics as separate sections
4. Add details about why LLM judge is necessary with specific examples where WER fails
5. Explain leaderboard properly with example directory structure and example outputs

Done. I've updated the Speech-to-Text documentation with:

1. **Evaluation process section** - Explains that each audio file is streamed and transcripts are shown in real-time with actual example output

2. **Intermediate saves and crash recovery** - Explains that intermediate results are saved after each audio, allowing resume

3. **Automatic retry logic** - Explains the retry mechanism: checks for missing transcripts, retries failed files, exits if no progress, can resume with same params

4. **Metrics section** - Split into:
   - **Accuracy metrics**: WER, String Similarity, LLM Judge Score with detailed explanations
   - **Why LLM Judge is necessary**: Table with specific examples where WER fails but LLM Judge works
   - **Latency metrics**: TTFB and Processing Time

5. **Output structure** - Added explanations for:
   - **logs**: Full debug logs with pipecat details
   - **results.log**: Human-readable terminal output

6. **Generate leaderboard section** - Includes:
   - **Prerequisites**: Explains that same output_dir must be used, shows directory structure example
   - **Example of what output_dir should look like before running leaderboard**
   - **Example of leaderboard outputs**: stt_leaderboard.xlsx with example table, all_metrics_by_run.png description</details></think>

Done. I've significantly expanded the Speech-to-Text documentation with:

1. **Evaluation process section** - Shows real-time output during evaluation with example terminal output

2. **Intermediate saves and crash recovery** - Explains automatic saving after each audio file

3. **Automatic retry logic** - Details the retry mechanism:
   - Checks for missing transcripts after processing
   - Retries failed files automatically
   - Exits if no progress is made
   - Can resume with the same parameters

4. **Metrics section** - Split into:
   - **Accuracy metrics**: WER, String Similarity, LLM Judge Score
   - **Why LLM Judge is necessary**: Table with specific examples where WER fails (like "1, 2, 3" vs "one, two, three")
   - **Latency metrics**: TTFB and Processing Time

5. **Output structure** - Detailed explanations for:
   - `logs`: Full debug logs with pipecat details
   - `results.log`: Human-readable terminal output

6. **Generate leaderboard section** - Includes:
   - Prerequisites explaining same `output_dir` must be used
   - Example directory structure before running leaderboard
   - Example leaderboard Excel output with sample table

update taxonomy and casing everywhere use

Speech to Text (S capital, t small, T capital)
same for TTS and Text to Text - use that instead of LLMs or Large Language models and STT should be followed by TTT and then TTS everywhere in sequence

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to update the taxonomy and casing everywhere to use:
- "Speech to Text" (not "Speech-to-Text" or "STT")
- "Text to Text" (not "LLM" or "Large Language Model")

And the order should be: Speech to Text → Text to Text → Text to Speech everywhere.

Let me find and update all the relevant files:
1. docs/python-sdk/overview.mdx
2. docs/python-sdk/speech-to-text.mdx
3. docs/python-sdk/text-to-speech.mdx

Done! I've updated the taxonomy and casing across all documentation files:

**Changes made:**

1. **Casing standardized to:**
   - "Speech to Text" (S capital, t small, T capital)
   - "Text to Text" (instead of LLM/Large Language Model)
   - "Text to Speech" (T capital, t small, S capital)

2. **Order updated to:** Speech to Text → Text to Text → Text to Speech everywhere

3. **Files updated:**
   - `docs/python-sdk/overview.mdx` - Updated card titles, descriptions, and config comments
   - `docs/python-sdk/speech-to-text.mdx` - Updated all references
   - `docs/python-sdk/text-to-text.mdx` - Renamed from large-language-model.mdx, updated all "Large Language Model" to "Text to Text"
   - `docs/python-sdk/text-to-speech.mdx` - Updated all references
   - `docs/python-sdk/voice-agent.mdx` - Updated all references, reordered supported providers
   - `docs/integrations/stt.mdx` - Updated title, description, and card text
   - `docs/integrations/llm.mdx` - Updated title, description, and card text to "Text to Text"
   - `docs/integrations/tts.mdx` - Updated title, description, and card text
   - `docs/docs.json` - Updated navigation to use `text-to-text` and reordered CLI pages

in python SDK add 2 sections - Test components and End to End tests
within that, keep Text Simulations and Voice simulations - remove the Text simulation section from the Text to text page

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants to reorganize the Python SDK structure:

1. Add 2 new sections: "Test components" and "End to End tests"
2. Under these sections:
   - Keep Text Simulations 
   - Keep Voice simulations
3. Remove the Text simulation section from the Text to Text page

So the structure would be something like:
- Test components (STT, TTT, TTS evaluations)
- End to End tests
  - Text Simulations (moved from TTT page)
  - Voice simulations (already exists as voice-agent)

Let me first read the current files to understand the structure, then make the changes.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants to restructure the Python SDK:

1. Create 2 sections: "Test components" and "End to End tests"
2. "Test components" should contain: Speech to Text, Text to Text, Text to Speech (individual component evaluations)
3. "End to End tests" should contain: Text Simulations and Voice simulations
4. Remove the Text simulation section from the Text to Text page

So I need to:1. Create a new file for Text Simulations (extract the simulation content from text-to-text.mdx)
2. Update the text-to-text.mdx to remove the simulation sections
3. Update the docs.json navigation to have the new structure4. Rename voice-agent.mdx to voice-simulations.mdx or similar

Let me create the new structure.</details></think>

Done! I've restructured the Python SDK with the new sections:

**New Structure:**

1. **Test Components** (evaluate individual components in isolation)
   - Speech to Text
   - Text to Text
   - Text to Speech

2. **End to End Tests** (full simulations with realistic scenarios)
   - Text Simulations (new file - extracted from Text to Text)
   - Voice Simulations (renamed from Voice Agent)

**Changes made:**

1. Created `text-simulations.mdx` - Contains all the simulation content that was previously in the Text to Text page
2. Updated `text-to-text.mdx` - Removed simulations section, now only contains test cases and leaderboard for tests
3. Renamed `voice-agent.mdx` → `voice-simulations.mdx` and updated the title
4. Updated `docs.json` - New navigation with 3 groups: "Python SDK" (overview), "Test Components", and "End to End Tests"
5. Updated `overview.mdx` - New layout with two sections and updated card links

I need to find all CSV examples in the documentation and convert them from comma-separated code blocks to Mintlify tables. Let me identify all the CSV examples:

1. **speech-to-text.mdx**:
   - Input `stt.csv` example (lines 23-27)
   - Output `results.csv` example (lines 137-141)

2. **text-to-speech.mdx**:
   - Input CSV example (lines 10-14)
   - Output `results.csv` example (lines 63-67)

3. **text-to-text.mdx**:
   - `leaderboard.csv` format (lines 182-186)

4. **text-simulations.mdx**:
   - `evaluation_results.csv` example (lines 152-156)
   - `results.csv` example (lines 162-166)
   - `leaderboard.csv` format (lines 206-210)

5. **voice-simulations.mdx**:
   - `evaluation_results.csv` example (lines 173-180)
   - `stt_results.csv` example (lines 188-192)
   - `results.csv` example (lines 198-202)

- cli/text-simulations (doesn't exist - this content is in cli/llm.mdx)
- cli/voice-simulations (file is cli/agent.mdx)

I need to:
1. Rename cli/stt.mdx → cli/speech-to-text.mdx (and update content)
2. Split cli/llm.mdx into cli/text-to-text.mdx (tests) and cli/text-simulations.mdx (simulations)

# Speech-to-Text Evaluation Quickstart

Pense allows you to evaluate multiple Speech-to-Text (STT) providers simultaneously using your own audio data. This guide will walk you through creating and analyzing an STT evaluation.

## Overview

STT evaluation helps you:
- Compare transcription accuracy across providers
- Measure latency and processing time
- Identify the best provider for your specific use case and language

## Step 1: Navigate to STT Evaluations

From the sidebar, click on **Speech to Text** to view all your STT evaluations. Click the **New STT evaluation** button to create a new evaluation.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/stt_overview.png" alt="STT Evaluations List" />
</Frame>

## Step 2: Configure Settings

On the **Settings** tab, configure your evaluation:

### Select Language

Choose the language of your audio files:
- **English**
- **Hindi**

### Select Providers

Choose up to **3 providers** to compare simultaneously:

| Provider | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Deepgram | High-accuracy speech recognition |
| OpenAI | Whisper-based transcription |
| Cartesia | Low-latency streaming STT |
| ElevenLabs | Multi-language support |
| Whisper (Groq) | Fast Whisper inference |
| Google | Google Cloud Speech-to-Text |
| Sarvam | Indic language specialist |

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/stt_new.png" alt="STT Settings - Provider Selection" />
</Frame>

## Step 3: Upload Your Dataset

Switch to the **Dataset** tab to add your audio samples.

### Option A: Manual Upload

1. Click **Upload .wav** to select an audio file
2. Enter the **reference transcription** (ground truth)
3. Click **Add another sample** to add more audio-text pairs

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/stt-dataset.png" alt="STT Dataset Upload" />
</Frame>

### Option B: Bulk Upload via ZIP

For larger datasets, upload a ZIP file containing:

```
your_dataset.zip
├── audios/
│   ├── sample_1.wav
│   ├── sample_2.wav
│   └── sample_3.wav
└── data.csv
```

The `data.csv` should have two columns:

```csv
audio_file,text
sample_1.wav,This is the reference transcription for sample 1.
sample_2.wav,This is the reference transcription for sample 2.
sample_3.wav,This is the reference transcription for sample 3.
```

<Tip>
Click **Download sample ZIP** to get a template with the correct structure.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Run Evaluation

Click the **Evaluate** button to start the evaluation. You'll be redirected to the results page where you can monitor progress in real-time.

## Step 5: View Results

### Outputs Tab

The **Outputs** tab shows results as each provider completes:

- **Left panel**: List of providers with status indicators
  - Yellow dot: In progress
  - Green checkmark: Completed successfully
  - Red X: Failed

- **Right panel**: Detailed results for the selected provider
  - Overall metrics (WER, String Similarity, LLM Judge Score)
  - Per-sample comparison of ground truth vs. prediction

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/stt_outputs.png" alt="STT Outputs View" />
</Frame>

### Leaderboard Tab

Once all providers complete, the **Leaderboard** tab shows a comparative analysis:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/stt_leaderboard.png" alt="STT Leaderboard View" />
</Frame>

## Understanding the Metrics

| Metric | Description | Preference |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **WER** (Word Error Rate) | Percentage of words that differ between reference and prediction | Lower is better |
| **String Similarity** | Character-level similarity score | Higher is better (0-1) |
| **LLM Judge Score** | Semantic equivalence evaluation (handles "9" vs "nine") | Pass is better |
| **TTFB** (Time To First Byte) | Latency until first response byte | Lower is better |
| **Processing Time** | Total transcription time | Lower is better |

<Info>
The **LLM Judge** metric is particularly useful because traditional metrics like WER may penalize semantically correct but differently formatted transcriptions. For example, "9" and "nine" would fail WER but pass LLM Judge.
</Info>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use representative audio samples">
    Include audio that matches your production environment - background noise levels, speaker accents, and audio quality should be similar.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include edge cases">
    Add samples with numbers, proper nouns, technical terms, and other challenging content to thoroughly test each provider.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test multiple languages">
    If your application supports multiple languages, run separate evaluations for each language to find the best provider per language.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider latency requirements">
    If your use case is latency-sensitive (like real-time voice agents), pay close attention to TTFB and processing time metrics.

1. The Quickstart section and Guides should be about the UI
2. The Python SDK documentation should be in the python-sdk section only, not in quickstart

They've provided a new quickstart page for Speech-to-Text Evaluation via UI. I need to:
1. Update the quickstart to be about the UI, not Python SDK
2. Create new quickstart pages for STT, TTS, LLM, and simulations (all UI-based)

Let me first update the main quickstart page and create the individual quickstart pages for UI-based evaluations.</details></think>

---

I'll restructure the quickstart to be about the UI and create separate pages for each evaluation type.

---

Done. I've restructured the documentation:

**Quickstart (`getting-started/quickstart.mdx`):**
- Now focused on UI installation and launching `pense ui`
- Links to guide pages for each evaluation type

**New Guide Pages (UI-focused):**
- `guides/stt-evaluation.mdx` - Speech to Text evaluation via UI
- `guides/ttt-evaluation.mdx` - Text to Text tests via UI
- `guides/tts-evaluation.mdx` - Text to Speech evaluation via UI
- `guides/text-simulations.mdx` - Text simulations via UI
- `guides/voice-simulations.mdx` - Voice simulations via UI

**Updated Navigation (`docs.json`):**
- Guides tab now has "Component Testing" and "End to End Tests" groups matching the Python SDK and CLI structure

The Python SDK documentation remains separate for programmatic usage.

Done! I've restructured the documentation:

**Getting Started tab now has:**
- **Get Started** group: introduction
- **Quickstart** group (UI-focused):
  - overview (installation, config, launch UI)
  - speech-to-text
  - text-to-text
  - text-to-speech
  - simulations
- **Core Concepts** group (metrics & concepts):
  - overview
  - speech-to-text (WER, String Similarity, LLM Judge, latency)
  - text-to-text (pass rate, evaluation types, test cases)
  - text-to-speech (LLM Judge, latency)
  - simulations (personas, scenarios, evaluation criteria)

**Removed:**
- Guides tab (content moved to Quickstart)
- Old getting-started/quickstart.mdx
- Old getting-started/core-concepts.mdx

**New files created:**
- `quickstart/overview.mdx`, `quickstart/speech-to-text.mdx`, etc.
- `core-concepts/overview.mdx`, `core-concepts/speech-to-text.mdx`, etc.

Let me find the bot.py file where STTConfig, TTSConfig, and LLMConfig are defined - this is likely where the provider creation logic exists.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I have a complete picture. The STT and TTS provider/language selection logic is duplicated in:

1. `pense/stt/eval.py` - run_stt_bot function
2. `pense/tts/eval.py` - run_tts_bot function  
3. `pense/agent/bot.py` - run_bot function

Each has its own provider selection if/elif blocks with similar but not identical configurations. I need to create a common utility function in `pense/utils.py` that can be used by all three modules.

Let me create:
1. `create_stt_service(provider, language)` - returns the appropriate STT service instance
2. `create_tts_service(provider, language)` - returns the appropriate TTS service instance
3. Associated language mapping helpers

I'll add these to `pense/utils.py`.</details></think>

---

Now I understand the pattern. The STT/TTS provider selection logic is duplicated in three places:
1. `pense/stt/eval.py`
2. `pense/tts/eval.py`
3. `pense/agent/bot.py`

I'll create common utility functions in `pense/utils.py` and then update all three modules to use them.

There are now many unused imports in stt/eval.py since we're using the common factory function. The individual STT service imports are no longer needed here. However, removing unused imports is not strictly necessary and could be a separate cleanup task. Let me verify the code works by checking if there are any import errors first.Let me also read the bot.py to see if there are unused imports there too.</details></think>

---

The refactoring is complete. Let me provide a summary of what was done:

**Created common utility functions in `pense/utils.py`:**

1. `get_stt_language(language, provider)` - Returns the appropriate Language enum based on language and provider
2. `get_tts_language(language, provider)` - Returns the appropriate Language enum based on language and provider
3. `TTS_VOICE_IDS` - Dictionary mapping providers and languages to voice IDs
4. `create_stt_service(provider, language)` - Factory function that creates STT service instances
5. `create_tts_service(provider, language, voice_id, instructions)` - Factory function that creates TTS service instances

**Updated modules to use the common utilities:**

1. **`pense/stt/eval.py`** - Replaced ~70 lines of provider selection logic with single `create_stt_service()` call
2. **`pense/tts/eval.py`** - Replaced ~70 lines of provider selection logic with single `create_tts_service()` call
3. **`pense/agent/bot.py`** - Replaced ~150 lines of provider selection logic with two factory function calls

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for provider configurations
- Consistent language/voice mappings across all modules
- Easier to add new providers (update only `utils.py`)
- Easier to maintain voice IDs and language mappings
- Reduced code duplication significantly

No linter errors. The unnecessary imports have been successfully removed from all three files. Let me also check the utils.py to ensure there are no unnecessary imports there as well after the changes.</details></think>

All unnecessary imports have been removed from the three files:

1. **`pense/stt/eval.py`** - Removed 12 STT service imports (DeepgramSTTService, OpenAISTTService, GoogleSTTService, CartesiaSTTService, GroqSTTService, SarvamSTTService, ElevenLabsRealtimeSTTService, SmallestSTTService, etc.)

2. **`pense/tts/eval.py`** - Removed 8 TTS service imports (SmallestTTSService, CartesiaTTSService, OpenAITTSService, GroqTTSService, GoogleTTSService, ElevenLabsTTSService, SarvamTTSService, Language)

3. **`pense/agent/bot.py`** - Removed 20+ STT/TTS service imports while keeping the LLM-related imports (OpenRouterLLMService, OpenAILLMService) that are still needed for the LLM configuration

The user wants me to apply the same refactoring to pense/agent/test.py - using the common utility functions for STT/TTS provider creation and removing unnecessary imports. Let me read the file first.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I can see this file has the same pattern of duplicated STT/TTS provider selection. I need to:
1. Add import for `create_stt_service` and `create_tts_service` from `pense.utils`
2. Replace the STT provider selection logic with `create_stt_service()`
3. Replace the TTS provider selection logic with `create_tts_service()`
4. Remove unnecessary STT/TTS service imports

However, I notice this file has additional configuration options like custom `voice_id`, `model`, and `instructions` that get passed through the config. I need to make sure the utility functions can handle these. Looking at my `create_tts_service` function, it already supports `voice_id` and `instructions` parameters.

But there's a complication - this file uses different default voice IDs in some cases and also has model configuration for TTS. Let me look at what options are needed:

For STT:
- provider
- language 
- model (for openai)

For TTS:
- provider
- language
- voice_id (optional, with provider/language defaults)
- model (for cartesia)
- instructions (for openai)

The current `create_tts_service` function supports `voice_id` and `instructions`, but not custom model. I need to update the utility function to support model customization or handle it differently.

Actually, looking at the test.py more carefully:
- For cartesia TTS, it uses `model=tts_config.model or "sonic-3"`
- For sarvam TTS, it uses `model=tts_config.model or "bulbul:v2"`

But my `create_tts_service` always uses hardcoded models. Let me update the utility function to support a `model` parameter as well.

Wait, but the user just asked to apply the same refactoring. Let me see if I can make it work with the existing utility functions, or if I need to update them.


The test.py file allows custom voice_id, model, and instructions through config. My utility functions already handle voice_id and instructions for OpenAI, but I need to extend them to accept an optional model parameter for providers like Cartesia and Sarvam that use configurable models. I should update the utility functions first to support this flexibility, then apply the refactoring to test.py.</details></think>

I need to update the utility functions to support the `model` parameter that `test.py` uses, then apply the refactoring.
