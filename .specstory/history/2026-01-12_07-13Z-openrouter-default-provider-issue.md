# Openrouter default provider issue (2026-01-12 07:13Z)

_**User (2026-01-11 09:21Z)**_

@fish (38-50) @run_tests.py (306-315) 

even though the provider is defaulted to openrouter when I run this command without specifying provider it is setting it to openai instead of openrouter

@fish (56-58) 

I install the package by running

uv pip install -e .

What's the issue?

The user is running a command `uv run pense llm tests run` and even though the `--provider` argument defaults to `"openrouter"` in the code, when they run the command without specifying the provider, it's using `"openai"` instead.

Let me look at the code to understand what's happening. The user has shared a snippet from `run_tests.py` showing the argument parser with `default="openrouter"` for the provider.

But the output shows:
```
Running command: pense --config ... --model openai/gpt-4.1 --provider openai --language english
```

So it's using `--provider openai` even though the default should be `openrouter`.

Let me read the full `run_tests.py` file to understand the flow better. The issue could be:
1. The provider is being inferred from the model name (openai/gpt-4.1 starts with "openai")
2. There's some logic that overrides the default based on the model
3. The CLI entry point might be different from what the code shows

Let me check the code.</details></think>

---

Let me examine the `run_tests.py` file to understand how the provider is being determined.

Looking at `run_tests.py`, I see the argparse configuration with `default="openrouter"` for the provider argument (line 313). The file looks fine.

But the user is running `uv run pense llm tests run ...` which suggests there's a CLI entry point. Let me check the CLI file to see how the command is structured.

The user mentioned they install the package with `uv pip install -e .`. Let me check the CLI file (`pense/cli.py`) since that's likely where the command routing happens.</details></think>

---

The issue is likely in the CLI entry point. Let me check the CLI file where the `pense llm tests run` command is defined.

Found it! The issue is on line 144 in `cli.py`:

```python
llm_tests_run_parser.add_argument("-p", "--provider", type=str, default="openai")
```

The CLI entry point (`cli.py`) has `default="openai"` for the provider, while the actual script (`run_tests.py`) has `default="openrouter"`.

When you run `pense llm tests run`, the CLI parses the arguments first with its own defaults, so the provider defaults to `"openai"` from `cli.py`.

The fix is to change line 144 in `cli.py` to match line 313 in `run_tests.py`, i.e., change `default="openai"` to `default="openrouter"`.</details></think>

---

Found the issue! The CLI entry point in `cli.py` has a different default for the `--provider` argument than `run_tests.py`.

Look at line 144 in `cli.py`:

```144:144:/Users/aman/Documents/repos/artpark/agentloop/pense/cli.py
llm_tests_run_parser.add_argument("-p", "--provider", type=str, default="openai")
```

It defaults to `"openai"`, while `run_tests.py` (line 313) defaults to `"openrouter"`.

When you run `pense llm tests run`, the CLI parses the arguments first using its own defaults from `cli.py`, so the provider defaults to `"openai"` regardless of what's in `run_tests.py`.

Here's the fix:

The fix has been applied. The user should now be able to run `pense llm tests run` without specifying the provider and it will default to `openrouter` instead of `openai`.</details></think>

---

The issue was that `cli.py` had `default="openai"` for the provider on line 144, while `run_tests.py` had `default="openrouter"`. Since the CLI parses arguments first before passing them to the underlying script, it was using the CLI's default (`openai`) instead of the script's default.

After reinstalling with `uv pip install -e .`, running `pense llm tests run` without specifying `--provider` will now default to `openrouter`.

_**User (2026-01-11 09:21Z)**_

update @README.md for llm tests to reflect that results.json and metrics.json are both given as outputs for llm unit tests and add sample shapes for each

The user wants me to update the README.md to reflect that both results.json and metrics.json are given as outputs for LLM tests, and add sample shapes for each. Let me look at the current README section for LLM tests and understand what needs to be updated.

Looking at the README, the LLM tests section shows this output structure:

```bash
/path/to/output/<test_config_name>/<model_name>
├── results.json
├── logs
```

The user wants me to add `metrics.json` to this list and add sample shapes for both `results.json` and `metrics.json`.

Let me check the run_tests.py file to understand what these files contain:

From run_tests.py (lines 407-416):
```python
with open(join(output_dir, "results.json"), "w") as f:
    json.dump(results, f, indent=4)

metrics = {
    "total": total_tests,
    "passed": passed_count,
}

with open(join(output_dir, "metrics.json"), "w") as f:
    json.dump(metrics, f, indent=4)
```

So `metrics.json` contains:
```json
{
  "total": <number>,
  "passed": <number>
}
```

And `results.json` contains an array of results, each with:
- "output": {"response": string, "tool_calls": array}
- "metrics": {"passed": boolean, "reasoning"?: string}
- "test_case": the test case object

Let me update the README section for LLM tests.</details></think>

The user wants me to update both cli.py and README.md to reflect that the llm tests run command no longer takes a -language argument. Looking at the run_tests.py file, I can see that the language argument is no longer in the argparse section (lines 289-323), and instead the language is taken from each test case (line 365: `language = test_case.get("language", "english")`).

So I need to:
1. Remove the `-l, --language` argument from `cli.py` for the `llm_tests_run_parser`
2. Update the README.md to remove mentions of the `-l` flag for `pense llm tests run`

The examples in cli.py don't have the `-l` flag already, so they're fine. 

Both files are now updated:

2. README.md - already didn't have `-l` in the `pense llm tests run` examples

Done. I've removed the `-l, --language` argument from the CLI for `pense llm tests run`. 

The README examples were already correct (they don't use `-l` for the llm tests run command), since the language is now specified per test case in the config file rather than as a CLI argument.
