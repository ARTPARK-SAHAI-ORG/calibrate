# Function for TTS output (2026-01-24 09:08Z)

_**User**_

@eval.py (177-192) 

make a function for this and use that here and do the same for google tts output

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to:
1. Extract the MP3 to WAV conversion logic into a reusable function
2. Use that function in the current location (ElevenLabs TTS)
3. Apply the same conversion for Google TTS output

Let me first read the full file to understand the context better, especially to see where the Google TTS code is and what its current output handling looks like.</details></think>

</details>
</tool-use>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I understand the full context. I need to:

1. Create a function for converting MP3 to WAV (saving the MP3 first, then converting)
2. Use that function in the ElevenLabs `synthesize_elevenlabs` function
3. Google TTS also outputs MP3 format (see line 105: `audio_encoding=texttospeech.AudioEncoding.MP3`), so I need to apply the same conversion there

Looking at the Google function (lines 94-149), it currently saves the MP3 directly to the audio_path without conversion to WAV. I need to add the same MP3 to WAV conversion there.

Let me create a helper function and apply it to both places.</details></think>

---

I can see that:
1. ElevenLabs outputs MP3 and converts to WAV (lines 177-192)
2. Google TTS also outputs MP3 format (line 105) but currently saves it directly without conversion to WAV

Let me create a helper function and apply it to both providers.

No linter errors. The changes are complete:

1. Created a new `convert_mp3_to_wav` function (lines 67-80) that:
   - Takes an MP3 path and WAV path as inputs
   - Uses pydub to convert MP3 to WAV
   - Optionally cleans up the MP3 file (default: True)

2. Updated `synthesize_elevenlabs` to use the new function (line 205)

3. Updated `synthesize_google` to also convert its MP3 output to WAV (lines 160-166)

The changes are minimal and focused on exactly what was asked.</details></think>

---

Done. I've made the following changes:

1. **Created a new `convert_mp3_to_wav` function** (lines 67-80):

```67:80:pense/tts/eval.py
def convert_mp3_to_wav(mp3_path: str, wav_path: str, cleanup: bool = True):
    """Convert MP3 file to WAV format.

    Args:
        mp3_path: Path to the input MP3 file
        wav_path: Path to save the output WAV file
        cleanup: If True, delete the MP3 file after conversion (default: True)
    """
    from pydub import AudioSegment

    audio = AudioSegment.from_mp3(mp3_path)
    audio.export(wav_path, format="wav")
    if cleanup:
        os.remove(mp3_path)
```

2. **Updated `synthesize_elevenlabs`** to use the new function (line 205)

3. **Updated `synthesize_google`** to also convert its MP3 output to WAV (lines 160-166), since it was outputting MP3 format but saving directly without conversion

_**User**_

Only go ahead if you made code changes (not just updated .cursor/rules/app-details.md):
    
    Update .cursor/rules/app-details.md with any new information about the codebase from the changes you just made. Include:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- New patterns or conventions introduced
- Dependencies or relationships affected
- Any gotchas or edge cases discovered

Don't maintain it as a changelog. Instead, look for what was already present but has become obsolete now. Remove or update it as necessary. Look for what is missing and add it.

Update README.md if any changes were made that conflict with what is present in the README.md relevant to the changes made or if any additions were made to the core functionality of the codebase that are not present in the README.md.

Update docs if any changes were made that conflict with what is present in the docs relevant to the changes made or if any additions were made to the core functionality of the codebase that are not present in the docs.

Keep the files organized and don't remove existing relevant context.

The user wants me to update documentation files if the code changes I made are relevant. Let me first check what the current state of these files is to see if my changes (adding `convert_mp3_to_wav` function and applying it to ElevenLabs and Google TTS) need to be documented.

The changes I made:
1. Created a `convert_mp3_to_wav` helper function
2. Used it in `synthesize_elevenlabs` (was already converting, just refactored)
3. Used it in `synthesize_google` (new - was saving MP3 directly, now converts to WAV)

This is an internal implementation detail - a helper function for audio format conversion. It doesn't change the public API or CLI interface. Let me check the relevant files to see if any updates are needed.</details></think>

Looking at the changes I made:
1. Created a `convert_mp3_to_wav` helper function
2. Used it in `synthesize_elevenlabs` (refactored existing behavior)
3. Used it in `synthesize_google` (new behavior - was saving MP3 directly, now converts to WAV)

Now let me check the documentation:

**app-details.md**: This file already mentions `pydub` for audio format conversion on line 450. The relevant section about TTS audio saving patterns is on lines 631-634. Line 634 already mentions "ElevenLabs streams MP3, converts to WAV using pydub after completion". I should update this to include Google as well since now Google also converts MP3 to WAV.

**README.md**: Looking at the README, it doesn't go into internal implementation details about audio format conversion. It describes the public API and usage patterns. The changes I made are internal implementation details (helper function extraction and making Google consistent with ElevenLabs). This doesn't affect the public API documented in README.md.

**docs/**: These are user-facing documentation about how to use the tool. The internal implementation of MP3 to WAV conversion isn't something users need to know about. The output format is still WAV, which is already documented.

Let me update the app-details.md to reflect that Google TTS now also converts MP3 to WAV, similar to ElevenLabs.</details></think>

Looking at the changes I made:
1. Created a `convert_mp3_to_wav` helper function
2. Refactored `synthesize_elevenlabs` to use it (same behavior, cleaner code)
3. Updated `synthesize_google` to convert MP3 to WAV (previously saved MP3 directly)

The `app-details.md` file has a section about TTS audio saving patterns (lines 631-634) that mentions ElevenLabs converts MP3 to WAV. I need to update this to include Google as well. The README and docs don't need updates since this is an internal implementation detail that doesn't affect the public API.

@eval.py (153-167) 

update this so that for google it is pcm that is the output audio format and convert that to wav

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user has changed the Google TTS audio encoding from MP3 to PCM (line 121). Now they want me to update the code that saves the audio to handle PCM format instead of MP3, and convert it to WAV.

Looking at the selected code (lines 153-167), it currently:
1. Collects audio chunks
2. Saves as MP3
3. Converts MP3 to WAV

Since the output is now PCM, I need to:
1. Collect audio chunks (same)
2. Save as WAV directly (PCM is raw audio data that can be wrapped in WAV format)

I can use the existing `save_audio` function which already handles raw PCM data and wraps it in WAV format. Let me check that function again.

Looking at lines 40-64, the `save_audio` function:
- Takes audio bytes and output path
- If bytes start with "RIFF" (WAV header), writes directly
- Otherwise, wraps raw PCM in WAV format with 1 channel, 16-bit, given sample rate

So for PCM output from Google, I should use `save_audio` instead of the MP3 conversion. The sample rate is 24000 (as set in the config).</details></think>

---

I'll update the Google TTS code to handle PCM output and save it as WAV directly using the existing `save_audio` function.

The changes look correct. Google TTS now:
1. Uses PCM encoding (line 121)
2. Saves the combined PCM audio as WAV using the `save_audio` function (lines 160-162)

The `save_audio` function will wrap the raw PCM data in a proper WAV format with 1 channel, 16-bit, 24000 Hz sample rate.</details></think>

Done. Updated the Google TTS code to:
1. Use PCM encoding (which you already changed)

The user is asking me to update documentation if I made code changes. Let me review what code changes I made in the last interaction:

1. Updated the Google TTS code to use PCM encoding instead of MP3
2. Changed the audio saving logic to use `save_audio()` function instead of `convert_mp3_to_wav()`

I already updated the app-details.md in the last turn to reflect this change. Let me verify that the update I made is accurate and complete.

The change I made to app-details.md was:
- Before: "Google and ElevenLabs stream MP3, then convert to WAV using `convert_mp3_to_wav()` helper function (uses pydub)"
- After: "Streaming providers (Google, Sarvam, Smallest) collect chunks then save combined audio (Google uses PCM encoding)" and "ElevenLabs streams MP3, then converts to WAV using `convert_mp3_to_wav()` helper function (uses pydub)"

This is an internal implementation detail change. The README.md and docs describe the public API and user-facing functionality, which hasn't changed - the output is still WAV files. So no updates needed there.

I did make code changes (updated Google TTS to use PCM and save_audio), and I already updated app-details.md in the previous turn. So I should confirm that no further documentation updates are needed.</details></think>

Let me read the sample output files to understand what the actual output looks like:
1. sample.csv - the input
2. sample_output/elevenlabs/results.csv
3. sample_output/elevenlabs/metrics.json
4. sample_output/openai/results.csv
5. sample_output/openai/metrics.json

I also need to read the docs for TTS to update them as well.</details></think>

Now I have a good understanding of what the current documentation looks like and what the actual sample output files contain. Let me compare:

**Key differences I notice:**

1. **results.csv columns**: The actual results.csv contains `ttfb` column, but the README and docs show it without `ttfb`. I need to update to include this column.

2. **Audio file naming**: The actual output uses `row_1.wav`, `row_2.wav` (matching the IDs), but the README and docs show `1.wav`, `2.wav`. I need to update this.

3. **Sample output**: The actual sample output uses the IDs from the CSV (`row_1`, `row_2`), and the audio files are named after the ID.

4. **Output terminal logs**: The current README shows "Streaming text [1/2]: <text_1>" which mentions "Streaming" - I need to check if this is still accurate.

Let me look at the actual eval code to understand what logs are printed:</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I understand the actual output format. Let me update the README and docs. The key changes:

1. **results.csv columns** - now includes `ttfb` column
2. **Audio file naming** - uses `{id}.wav` format (e.g., `row_1.wav`, `row_2.wav`), not numbered like `1.wav`, `2.wav`
3. **Sample output logs** - The actual output format is:
   - `Processing [1/2]: row_1`
   - `TTFB: X.XXXs`
   - `Successfully synthesized: X texts`
   - `Running LLM judge evaluation...`
   - `LLM Judge Score: X.X`
   
4. **No more `logs` directory** - Looking at the output structure in the examples, there's no `logs` directory, just `audios/`, `results.csv`, and `metrics.json`

Let me update the README first, then the docs.</details></think>

Only go ahead if you made code changes (not just updated .cursor/rules/app-details.md):
    
    Update .cursor/rules/app-details.md with any new information about the codebase from the changes you just made. Include:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- New patterns or conventions introduced
- Dependencies or relationships affected
- Any gotchas or edge cases discovered

Don't maintain it as a changelog. Instead, look for what was already present but has become obsolete now. Remove or update it as necessary. Look for what is missing and add it.

Update README.md if any changes were made that conflict with what is present in the README.md relevant to the changes made or if any additions were made to the core functionality of the codebase that are not present in the README.md.

Update docs if any changes were made that conflict with what is present in the docs relevant to the changes made or if any additions were made to the core functionality of the codebase that are not present in the docs.

Keep the files organized and don't remove existing relevant context.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Looking at the results, I see that `processing_time` references in the TTS-related documentation have already been removed in a previous session (according to the specstory history). The remaining references are:

1. **app-details.md line 545**: STT leaderboard charts - this is correct, STT still has processing_time
2. **README.md lines 982, 984, 1016, 1020**: These are in the voice agent simulations section, NOT the TTS section, so they should stay
3. **docs/cli/voice-simulations.mdx line 145**: Voice simulations, should stay
4. **docs/python-sdk/speech-to-text.mdx line 230**: STT leaderboard, should stay  
5. **docs/cli/speech-to-text.mdx line 125**: STT leaderboard, should stay
6. **docs/python-sdk/voice-simulations.mdx lines 178, 181**: Voice simulations, should stay

So the remaining `processing_time` references are either for STT or voice simulations, not TTS eval/leaderboard.

My change was specifically to the TTS leaderboard to remove `processing_time` from `TARGET_METRICS`. Let me check if there are any TTS-specific documentation that still references `processing_time` for the leaderboard.

Looking at the README and app-details, I see that the TTS leaderboard already only mentions `llm_judge_score.png` and `ttfb.png` - there's no `processing_time.png` for TTS. So the documentation is already correct.

Actually, let me double-check the app-details.md line 545 more carefully - it mentions STT charts include processing_time.png, but I need to verify the TTS section doesn't mention it.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Good, looking at the app-details.md, the TTS leaderboard section already only lists `llm_judge_score.png` and `ttfb.png` (line 546), which is correct after my change. The `processing_time` references in the search results are:

1. In the `.specstory` history files (not actual documentation)
2. In README.md line 984 - this is in the voice simulations section, not TTS eval section

Let me check the README.md line 984 to confirm it's about voice simulations, not TTS.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
I can see that the `processing_time` references in README.md (lines 982 and 984) are in the **Voice Agent Simulations** section, not the TTS evaluation section. These are different - voice simulations still use pipecat which tracks processing_time for each processor (STT, LLM, TTS). So these references should stay.

My change to remove `processing_time` from the TTS leaderboard is already correctly reflected in the documentation:
- app-details.md line 546 correctly shows TTS leaderboard charts as `llm_judge_score.png`, `ttfb.png` (without processing_time)

The documentation is already accurate for this change. The remaining `processing_time` references are for:
1. STT leaderboard - still has processing_time
2. Voice agent simulations - still tracks processing_time per processor

So no documentation updates are needed for this change.</details></think>

These are different from TTS eval and should remain. The documentation is already accurate for my code change - no updates needed.

Only go ahead if you made code changes (not just updated .cursor/rules/app-details.md):
    
    Update .cursor/rules/app-details.md with any new information about the codebase from the changes you just made. Include:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- New patterns or conventions introduced
- Dependencies or relationships affected
- Any gotchas or edge cases discovered

Don't maintain it as a changelog. Instead, look for what was already present but has become obsolete now. Remove or update it as necessary. Look for what is missing and add it.

Update README.md if any changes were made that conflict with what is present in the README.md relevant to the changes made or if any additions were made to the core functionality of the codebase that are not present in the README.md.

Update docs if any changes were made that conflict with what is present in the docs relevant to the changes made or if any additions were made to the core functionality of the codebase that are not present in the docs.

Keep the files organized and don't remove existing relevant context.
