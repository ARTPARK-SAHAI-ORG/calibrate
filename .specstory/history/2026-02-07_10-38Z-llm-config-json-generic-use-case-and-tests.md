# Llm config.json generic use case and tests (2026-02-07 10:38Z)

_**User**_

update @examples/llm/config.json so that is is more generic (instead of being hyperspecific) a simpler use case but still makes use of webhook tool and structured output tool and the tests cover next reply test as well as tool invocation test for both types of tests

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high, mode Agent)**_

I'll read the current config file to understand its structure and then simplify it while keeping the webhook tool, structured output tool, and tests for next reply and tool invocation.

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file_v2** • Read file: /Users/aman/Documents/repos/artpark/agentloop/examples/llm/config.json</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

Now I'll update the config to be more generic while keeping the webhook tool, structured output tool (client type), and including both next reply tests and tool invocation tests.

<tool-use data-tool-type="write" data-tool-name="edit_file_v2">

<details><summary>Tool use: **edit_file_v2** • Edit file: /Users/aman/Documents/repos/artpark/agentloop/examples/llm/config.json</summary>

Status: **loading**

</details>

</tool-use>
