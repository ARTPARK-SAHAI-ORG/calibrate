The user wants to update "Examples" to "Use cases" in the docs page. Let me first read the docs index page to understand what needs to be changed.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
I don't see "Examples" in this file. Let me check the docs.json file which likely contains the navigation structure.</details></think>

---

I don't see "Examples" in the index.mdx file. Let me check the docs navigation configuration.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Found it! On lines 108-116, there's a tab called "Examples" with a group also called "Examples". The user wants to change these to "Use cases". I need to update:
1. Line 108: `"tab": "Examples"` → `"tab": "Use cases"`
2. Line 111: `"group": "Examples"` → `"group": "Use cases"`

Let me make these changes.</details></think>

---

Found it. I'll update "Examples" to "Use cases" in the navigation configuration.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The change has been made. Both the tab name and the group name have been updated from "Examples" to "Use cases". The page reference `examples/overview` remains unchanged since it's a file path, not a display name.</details></think>

---

Done. I've updated both the tab name and group name from "Examples" to "Use cases" in `docs/docs.json`.

_**User**_

make the use cases page show up like this

---

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants to make the "Use cases" page look like the screenshot they shared. The screenshot shows:
1. A header "Browse Examples & Recipes" (which should probably be "Browse Use Cases" or similar)
2. Main title "Examples" (should be "Use cases")
3. Description: "Complete applications and quickstart demos to accelerate your Pipecat development"
4. Cards with:
   - A tag/category (like "Quickstart", "Simple Chatbot")
   - A subcategory (like "Getting Started", "Web & Mobile")
   - A description
   - A "View Example →" link

Let me first check if there's an examples/overview.mdx file that I need to update.</details></think>

---

Let me check the current examples overview page to update it.

---

File not found

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The file doesn't exist yet. I need to create the examples folder and the overview.mdx file. Let me check what structure exists in the docs folder.</details></think>

---

The file doesn't exist yet. Let me create the examples folder and the overview page with the design you showed.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I need to create the overview.mdx file with a similar structure to the screenshot. The screenshot shows:
- A suptitle "Browse Examples & Recipes" 
- Title "Examples"
- Description about accelerating development
- Cards with categories/tags showing use cases

For Pense, I should adapt this to show use cases relevant to the product (voice agent evaluation). Let me create this page.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
I've created the Use cases page with a similar structure to the screenshot. It has:
- A header "Browse Use Cases & Recipes"
- Title "Use cases"
- Description
- Cards with tags, categories, descriptions, and "View Example →" links

The cards include relevant use cases for Pense:
1. Quickstart - Getting Started
2. Simulations - End to End Testing
3. Leaderboards - Provider Comparison
4. Test Suites - LLM Evaluation

This should match the visual style shown in the screenshot.</details></think>

---

Done. I've created the Use cases page at `docs/examples/overview.mdx` with a similar layout to the screenshot you shared. It includes:

- A "Browse Use Cases & Recipes" header
- Title "Use cases" with description
- Cards showing different use cases with:
  - Category tags (Quickstart, Simulations, Leaderboards, Test Suites)
  - Subcategories (Getting Started, End to End Testing, etc.)
  - Descriptions
  - "View Example →" links

Only go ahead if you made code changes (not just updated .cursor/rules/app-details.md):
    
    Update .cursor/rules/app-details.md with any new information about the codebase from the changes you just made. Include:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- New patterns or conventions introduced
- Dependencies or relationships affected
- Any gotchas or edge cases discovered

Don't maintain it as a changelog. Instead, look for what was already present but has become obsolete now. Remove or update it as necessary. Look for what is missing and add it.

Update README.md if any changes were made that conflict with what is present in the README.md relevant to the changes made or if any additions were made to the core functionality of the codebase that are not present in the README.md.

Update docs if any changes were made that conflict with what is present in the docs relevant to the changes made or if any additions were made to the core functionality of the codebase that are not present in the docs.

Keep the files organized and don't remove existing relevant context.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to update documentation files based on the changes I made. Let me review what I changed:

1. Updated `docs/docs.json` - Changed "Examples" to "Use cases" in the navigation (both tab and group name)
2. Created `docs/examples/overview.mdx` - New Use cases page with cards showing different use cases

Now I need to:
1. Check `.cursor/rules/app-details.md` to see if there's anything relevant to update
2. Check `README.md` to see if it mentions anything about examples/use cases
3. The docs themselves were what I changed, so no conflict there

Let me read these files.</details></think>

Let me check the relevant files to see if any updates are needed.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Looking at the files:

1. **`.cursor/rules/app-details.md`** - Line 560-564 lists the documentation tabs as:
   - Getting Started
   - Integrations (STT, LLM, TTS providers)
   - Python SDK
   - CLI

   This is outdated since I added a "Use cases" tab. I should update this.

2. **`README.md`** - At the end (lines 1158-1162), it mentions the documentation but doesn't list the tabs. There's no conflict with my changes here.

I should update the app-details.md to include the "Use cases" tab in the documentation tabs section.</details></think>

---

I need to update `.cursor/rules/app-details.md` to reflect the new "Use cases" tab in the documentation. The README doesn't need changes as it doesn't list the specific documentation tabs.

I made the following code changes:
1. Changed "Examples" to "Use cases" in docs/docs.json navigation
2. Created docs/examples/overview.mdx with a Use cases page layout
3. Changed GitHub URLs from artpark/pense to artpark/agentloop in docs/docs.json and docs/cli/overview.mdx

Let me check if:
1. The app-details.md needs to be updated - it mentions "Documentation Tabs" but doesn't list "Examples" or "Use cases" specifically
2. README.md mentions the GitHub URL - I should check and update if needed

Let me check the app-details.md for the Documentation section and see if it needs updating, and check README.md for the GitHub URL.</details></think>

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The change I made was updating the Text to Text integrations page to add links to model documentation for OpenAI and OpenRouter. This is a minor documentation-only change that doesn't affect the codebase architecture or patterns.

Let me check if:
1. app-details.md mentions anything about LLM providers that would need updating - it already lists "openai, openrouter" as supported providers
2. README.md mentions model links - unlikely

This is a very minor documentation enhancement (adding external links to provider model pages). It doesn't change any patterns, conventions, or core functionality. The app-details.md already correctly lists the supported LLM providers. This change doesn't need any updates to app-details.md or README.md since it's just adding helpful external links to the docs, not changing any core functionality or patterns.

I should not make unnecessary changes. This was a minor docs enhancement that doesn't require updates to app-details.md or README.md.</details></think>

The change I made was a minor documentation enhancement - adding external links to model documentation in the Text to Text integrations page. This doesn't affect the codebase architecture, patterns, or core functionality.

The `app-details.md` already correctly lists the supported LLM providers ("openai, openrouter"), and the README.md doesn't need updates since no core functionality changed - just helpful external links were added to the docs.

No updates needed to `app-details.md` or `README.md` for this change.

Now I need to update both pages with the model information from the TypeScript data provided by the user. Let me extract the relevant info:

**STT Providers:**

**TTS Providers:**
- Cartesia: model "sonic-3", voiceId "Riya", website "https://cartesia.ai"
- OpenAI: model "gpt-4o-mini-tts", voiceId "coral", website "https://openai.com"

_**User**_

Only go ahead if you made code changes (not just updated .cursor/rules/app-details.md):
    
    Update .cursor/rules/app-details.md with any new information about the codebase from the changes you just made. Include:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- New patterns or conventions introduced
- Dependencies or relationships affected
- Any gotchas or edge cases discovered

Don't maintain it as a changelog. Instead, look for what was already present but has become obsolete now. Remove or update it as necessary. Look for what is missing and add it.

Update README.md if any changes were made that conflict with what is present in the README.md relevant to the changes made or if any additions were made to the core functionality of the codebase that are not present in the README.md.

Update docs if any changes were made that conflict with what is present in the docs relevant to the changes made or if any additions were made to the core functionality of the codebase that are not present in the docs.

Keep the files organized and don't remove existing relevant context.

I made changes to the STT and TTS integrations documentation pages - adding model names, default voice IDs, and website links. These are documentation-only changes that don't affect the codebase architecture or patterns.

Let me check if app-details.md mentions the specific model names for STT/TTS providers. If it has outdated model names, I should update them.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The app-details.md already has accurate information about:
- The chirp_3 model (default) and chirp_2 (for Sindhi) for Google STT
- Groq TTS using Orpheus model
- ElevenLabs using eleven_v3 for Sindhi

The changes I made to the docs were just adding model names to the integrations pages tables. The app-details.md doesn't need specific model name updates since it focuses on architectural patterns and gotchas rather than specific model versions in tables.

The README.md also doesn't need updates since it doesn't list specific STT/TTS model names - it's more about usage examples.

These were purely documentation enhancement changes (adding model/voice info to integration pages), not core functionality changes. No updates needed to app-details.md or README.md.</details></think>

The changes I made were purely documentation enhancements - adding model names, default voices, and website links to the integration pages. The `app-details.md` already has accurate information about the architectural patterns and special cases (like Sindhi language handling, model overrides, etc.).

The README.md also doesn't list specific model versions in tables, so no updates needed there either.

No updates required to `app-details.md` or `README.md` for these documentation table enhancements.

The user wants me to include all possible models for TTS and STT providers, including edge cases like eleven_v3 for ElevenLabs. Looking at the TypeScript data they provided earlier, I can see:

**STT Providers:**
- Deepgram: nova-3
- OpenAI: gpt-4o-transcribe
- Cartesia: ink
- ElevenLabs: scribe-v2
- Groq: whisper-large-v3-turbo
- Google: chirp-3 (with chirp-2 for Sindhi via modelOverrides)
- Sarvam: saarika-v2.5
- Smallest AI: pulse

**TTS Providers:**
- Cartesia: sonic-3
- OpenAI: gpt-4o-mini-tts
- Groq: orpheus
- Google: chirp_3 (with gemini for Sindhi via modelOverrides)
- ElevenLabs: eleven_multilingual_v2 (with eleven_v3 for Sindhi via modelOverrides)
- Sarvam: bulbul:v3-beta

Now I need to update both pages to include the model overrides/edge cases. From the TypeScript data:

**STT Model Overrides:**
- Google: chirp-2 for Sindhi

**TTS Model Overrides:**
- Google: gemini for Sindhi
- ElevenLabs: eleven_v3 for Sindhi

I'll add a "Model Overrides" or "Notes" section to document these edge cases.</details></think>

Done. I've updated both pages with model overrides sections that document the edge cases:

**STT:**
- Google uses chirp-2 for Sindhi (instead of chirp-3)

**TTS:**
- Google uses gemini model for Sindhi
- ElevenLabs uses eleven_v3 for Sindhi
- Added note that Groq only supports English</details></think>

---

Done. Updated both integration pages with model overrides sections:

**STT integrations** - Added:
- Model Overrides table showing Google uses `chirp-2` for Sindhi
- Note explaining the region difference (`asia-southeast1` vs `us`)

**TTS integrations** - Added:
- Model Overrides table showing:
  - Google uses `gemini` model for Sindhi
  - ElevenLabs uses `eleven_v3` for Sindhi
- Notes explaining:
  - Google's Gemini TTS streaming API details for Sindhi
  - ElevenLabs' `text_to_dialogue` API usage for Sindhi
  - Groq only supports English (Orpheus limitation)

_**User**_

Only go ahead if you made code changes (not just updated .cursor/rules/app-details.md):
    
    Update .cursor/rules/app-details.md with any new information about the codebase from the changes you just made. Include:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- New patterns or conventions introduced
- Dependencies or relationships affected
- Any gotchas or edge cases discovered

Don't maintain it as a changelog. Instead, look for what was already present but has become obsolete now. Remove or update it as necessary. Look for what is missing and add it.

Update README.md if any changes were made that conflict with what is present in the README.md relevant to the changes made or if any additions were made to the core functionality of the codebase that are not present in the README.md.

Update docs if any changes were made that conflict with what is present in the docs relevant to the changes made or if any additions were made to the core functionality of the codebase that are not present in the docs.

Keep the files organized and don't remove existing relevant context.

update @docs/core-concepts/text-to-text.mdx by properly explaining what a test case means as created in for @pense/llm/run_tests.py but following the UI mentioned in @docs/quickstart/text-to-text.mdx 

don't talk about the UI as much as the core concept of a test having a conversation history and then the conversation so far is the input with the agent's next output being tested - the output could be a tool call or a response and to check response quality one needs to define the criteria for what a good response looks like or for tool call test they need to define what tool should be called or not be called and with what params optionally or any params at all.

The user wants me to update the core-concepts/text-to-text.mdx file to better explain what a test case means. Let me first read the relevant files to understand:
1. The current core-concepts/text-to-text.mdx

3. The quickstart/text-to-text.mdx for context

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I understand the test case structure. Let me rewrite the core-concepts/text-to-text.mdx to better explain what a test case is:

Key concepts from the code:
1. A test case has a conversation history (the conversation so far)
2. The model generates the next output (either a response or tool calls)
3. Two evaluation types:
   - `tool_call`: Check if the right tool was called with the right parameters
   - `response`: Use LLM Judge to evaluate if the response meets criteria

The user wants me to focus on the concept, not the UI. I should explain:
- What a test case is conceptually
- The conversation history as input
- The agent's next output being tested
- Two types of outputs: tool call or response
- How to define expectations for each

Let me rewrite the page.</details></think>

Done. I've rewritten the core-concepts/text-to-text.mdx page to better explain the concept of a test case:1. **What is a Test Case?** - Clear explanation with a visual diagram showing the flow: conversation history (input) → agent generates output → evaluate output → pass/fail2. **Conversation History** - Explained as the context the agent sees before generating output3. **Agent Output Types** - Two types: text response or tool call4. **Evaluation Types:**   - **Tool Call Tests** - When to use, how to specify tool name and arguments, matching rules
   - **Response Tests** - When to use, how to write good criteria, how LLM Judge evaluates5. **Complete Test Case Structure** - Shows the full structure with all parts6. Kept the existing useful content (Pass Rate, Tools, Output Files, Next Steps)The content now focuses on the core concept rather than the UI, explaining:
- The conversation history is the input
- The agent's next output is being tested
- Output can be a tool call or response
- For response tests, define criteria for what a good response looks like
- For tool call tests, define what tool should be called and with what params</details></think>

Done. I've rewritten the `docs/core-concepts/text-to-text.mdx` page to properly explain test cases conceptually:

**Key changes:**

1. **What is a Test Case?** - Added a clear explanation with a visual ASCII diagram showing the flow: conversation history → agent generates output → evaluate → pass/fail

2. **Conversation History** - Explained as the context (input) the agent sees before generating its next output

3. **Agent Output Types** - Clearly distinguished between text responses and tool calls

4. **Evaluation Types:**
   - **Tool Call Tests** - Explained when to use them, how to specify tool names and arguments, with a table showing matching rules (tool only, tool + args, tool NOT called)
   - **Response Tests** - Explained when to use them, how to write good criteria with examples of good vs bad criteria, how LLM Judge evaluates

5. **Complete Test Case Structure** - Shows the full structure with comments explaining each part

The content now focuses on the core concept rather than UI mechanics, explaining that:
- The conversation history is the input
- The agent's next output is what gets tested
- Output can be either a tool call or text response
- For response tests: define criteria describing what a good response looks like
- For tool call tests: define what tool should be called, optionally with specific parameters

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The app-details.md already has accurate information about:
- Test types (Tool Call Tests and Response Tests)
- Test Case Structure with history, evaluation, and settings
- The evaluation types (tool_call or response)
- Output formats

The documentation change I made was just improving the explanation in the docs site - it doesn't change any patterns or functionality. The app-details.md is still accurate.

No updates needed to app-details.md or README.md.</details></think>

The `app-details.md` already has accurate information about LLM test cases:
- Test types (Tool Call Tests and Response Tests)
- Test Case Structure with history, evaluation (tool_call or response type), and settings
- Output formats (results.json with output, metrics, test_case)

The documentation change I made was purely an improvement to the explanation in the docs site - making it clearer conceptually. It doesn't change any patterns, architecture, or functionality in the codebase.

No updates needed to `app-details.md` or `README.md`.
