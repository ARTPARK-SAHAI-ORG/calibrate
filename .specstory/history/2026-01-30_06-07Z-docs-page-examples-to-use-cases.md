<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants to update "Examples" to "Use cases" in the docs page. Let me first read the docs index page to understand what needs to be changed.</details></think>

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file_v2** • Read file: /Users/aman/Documents/repos/artpark/agentloop/docs/index.mdx</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
I don't see "Examples" in this file. Let me check the docs.json file which likely contains the navigation structure.</details></think>

---

I don't see "Examples" in the index.mdx file. Let me check the docs navigation configuration.

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file_v2** • Read file: /Users/aman/Documents/repos/artpark/agentloop/docs/docs.json</summary>

</tool-use>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Found it! On lines 108-116, there's a tab called "Examples" with a group also called "Examples". The user wants to change these to "Use cases". I need to update:
1. Line 108: `"tab": "Examples"` → `"tab": "Use cases"`
2. Line 111: `"group": "Examples"` → `"group": "Use cases"`

Let me make these changes.</details></think>

---

Found it. I'll update "Examples" to "Use cases" in the navigation configuration.

<tool-use data-tool-type="write" data-tool-name="edit_file_v2">

<details><summary>Tool use: **edit_file_v2** • Edit file: /Users/aman/Documents/repos/artpark/agentloop/docs/docs.json</summary>

</details>

</tool-use>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The change has been made. Both the tab name and the group name have been updated from "Examples" to "Use cases". The page reference `examples/overview` remains unchanged since it's a file path, not a display name.</details></think>

---

Done. I've updated both the tab name and group name from "Examples" to "Use cases" in `docs/docs.json`.

---

_**User**_

make the use cases page show up like this

---

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants to make the "Use cases" page look like the screenshot they shared. The screenshot shows:
1. A header "Browse Examples & Recipes" (which should probably be "Browse Use Cases" or similar)
2. Main title "Examples" (should be "Use cases")
3. Description: "Complete applications and quickstart demos to accelerate your Pipecat development"
4. Cards with:
   - A tag/category (like "Quickstart", "Simple Chatbot")
   - A subcategory (like "Getting Started", "Web & Mobile")
   - A description
   - A "View Example →" link

Let me first check if there's an examples/overview.mdx file that I need to update.</details></think>

---

Let me check the current examples overview page to update it.

---

File not found

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The file doesn't exist yet. I need to create the examples folder and the overview.mdx file. Let me check what structure exists in the docs folder.</details></think>

---

The file doesn't exist yet. Let me create the examples folder and the overview page with the design you showed.

<tool-use data-tool-type="shell" data-tool-name="run_terminal_command_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **run_terminal_command_v2** • Run command: mkdir -p /Users/aman/Documents/repos/artpark/agentloop/docs/examples</summary>

```bash
mkdir -p /Users/aman/Documents/repos/artpark/agentloop/docs/examples
```
</details>
</tool-use>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I need to create the overview.mdx file with a similar structure to the screenshot. The screenshot shows:
- A suptitle "Browse Examples & Recipes" 
- Title "Examples"
- Description about accelerating development
- Cards with categories/tags showing use cases

For Pense, I should adapt this to show use cases relevant to the product (voice agent evaluation). Let me create this page.</details></think>

</tool-use>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
I've created the Use cases page with a similar structure to the screenshot. It has:
- A header "Browse Use Cases & Recipes"
- Title "Use cases"
- Description
- Cards with tags, categories, descriptions, and "View Example →" links

The cards include relevant use cases for Pense:
1. Quickstart - Getting Started
2. Simulations - End to End Testing
3. Leaderboards - Provider Comparison
4. Test Suites - LLM Evaluation

This should match the visual style shown in the screenshot.</details></think>

---

Done. I've created the Use cases page at `docs/examples/overview.mdx` with a similar layout to the screenshot you shared. It includes:

- A "Browse Use Cases & Recipes" header
- Title "Use cases" with description
- Cards showing different use cases with:
  - Category tags (Quickstart, Simulations, Leaderboards, Test Suites)
  - Subcategories (Getting Started, End to End Testing, etc.)
  - Descriptions
  - "View Example →" links

Only go ahead if you made code changes (not just updated .cursor/rules/app-details.md):
    
    Update .cursor/rules/app-details.md with any new information about the codebase from the changes you just made. Include:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- New patterns or conventions introduced
- Dependencies or relationships affected
- Any gotchas or edge cases discovered

Don't maintain it as a changelog. Instead, look for what was already present but has become obsolete now. Remove or update it as necessary. Look for what is missing and add it.

Update README.md if any changes were made that conflict with what is present in the README.md relevant to the changes made or if any additions were made to the core functionality of the codebase that are not present in the README.md.

Update docs if any changes were made that conflict with what is present in the docs relevant to the changes made or if any additions were made to the core functionality of the codebase that are not present in the docs.

Keep the files organized and don't remove existing relevant context.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to update documentation files based on the changes I made. Let me review what I changed:

1. Updated `docs/docs.json` - Changed "Examples" to "Use cases" in the navigation (both tab and group name)
2. Created `docs/examples/overview.mdx` - New Use cases page with cards showing different use cases

Now I need to:
1. Check `.cursor/rules/app-details.md` to see if there's anything relevant to update
2. Check `README.md` to see if it mentions anything about examples/use cases
3. The docs themselves were what I changed, so no conflict there

Let me read these files.</details></think>

Let me check the relevant files to see if any updates are needed.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Looking at the files:

1. **`.cursor/rules/app-details.md`** - Line 560-564 lists the documentation tabs as:
   - Getting Started
   - Integrations (STT, LLM, TTS providers)
   - Python SDK
   - CLI

   This is outdated since I added a "Use cases" tab. I should update this.

2. **`README.md`** - At the end (lines 1158-1162), it mentions the documentation but doesn't list the tabs. There's no conflict with my changes here.

I should update the app-details.md to include the "Use cases" tab in the documentation tabs section.</details></think>

---

I need to update `.cursor/rules/app-details.md` to reflect the new "Use cases" tab in the documentation. The README doesn't need changes as it doesn't list the specific documentation tabs.

Done. Updated the GitHub URL from `https://github.com/artpark/pense` to `https://github.com/artpark/agentloop` in 4 places:
- `docs/docs.json` (3 occurrences - anchors, navbar, and footer)
- `docs/cli/overview.mdx` (1 occurrence - git clone command)

I made the following code changes:
1. Changed "Examples" to "Use cases" in docs/docs.json navigation
2. Created docs/examples/overview.mdx with a Use cases page layout
3. Changed GitHub URLs from artpark/pense to artpark/agentloop in docs/docs.json and docs/cli/overview.mdx

Let me check if:
1. The app-details.md needs to be updated - it mentions "Documentation Tabs" but doesn't list "Examples" or "Use cases" specifically
2. README.md mentions the GitHub URL - I should check and update if needed

Let me check the app-details.md for the Documentation section and see if it needs updating, and check README.md for the GitHub URL.</details></think>

---

I made code changes (GitHub URL update and Use cases page). Let me check if README.md needs the GitHub URL updated.
