"नमस्ते। umm हां, मेरा नाम.. . राजेश प्रसाद।","नमस्ते, अम् हां, मेरा नाम डॉट राजेश प्रसाद",1,"The source string says 'umm' and the transcription says 'अम्', which is a reasonable phonetic match. The source has '.. .' (possibly indicating a pause or hesitation), while the transcription has 'डॉट' (the word for 'dot'). The rest of the content matches: 'नमस्ते', 'हां, मेरा नाम', and 'राजेश प्रसाद'. The use of 'डॉट' instead of '.. .' is a difference in representation, but both indicate a pause or hesitation, not a value change. Therefore, the underlying values match."
