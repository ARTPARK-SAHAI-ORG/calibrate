Pense is an open-source Python framework for simulation and testing of voice agents. It enables automated, repeatable testing at scale.

The framework provides tools to evaluate individual components (STT, TTS, LLM) and run end-to-end voice agent simulations that verify conversational responses and tool usage across thousands of scenarios.

Want to dive right in? Check out the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) to run your first Pense evaluation.

## Why Pense?

Testing voice agents manually is slow, inconsistent, and doesn't scale. Pense solves this by providing:

- **Component-level evaluation**: Test STT, TTS, and LLM independently to identify bottlenecks
- **Comprehensive metrics**: WER, string similarity, LLM judge scores, TTFB, and processing time
- **Persona-based simulations**: Define user personas and scenarios to test diverse conversation flows
- **Automated evaluation**: LLM judges assess transcript quality and agent behavior
- **Leaderboards**: Compare providers side-by-side with generated reports and visualizations

## Built on Pipecat

Pense is built on top of [Pipecat](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat), a framework for building voice agents. This means Pense inherits Pipecat's robust audio processing pipeline and provider integrations while adding testing and evaluation capabilities on top.
