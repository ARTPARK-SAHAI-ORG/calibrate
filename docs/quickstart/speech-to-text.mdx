You can also bulk upload your dataset as a ZIP file having the following structure:

```
your_dataset.zip
|-- audios/
|   |-- sample_1.wav
|   |-- sample_2.wav
|   |-- sample_3.wav
|-- data.csv
```

The `data.csv` should have two columns:

| audio_file   | text                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| sample_1.wav | This is the reference transcription for sample 1. |
| sample_2.wav | This is the reference transcription for sample 2. |
| sample_3.wav | This is the reference transcription for sample 3. |
