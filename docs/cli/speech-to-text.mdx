The interactive UI guides you through the full evaluation process:

1. **Language selection** — pick from 10+ supported Indic languages
2. **Provider selection** — choose providers (only those supporting your language are shown)
3. **Input directory** — path to the directory containing your audio files and reference transcripts

The input directory should have this structure:

```
/path/to/data/
├── stt.csv
└── audios/
    ├── audio_1.wav
    └── audio_2.wav
```

The **stt.csv** file contains the reference transcriptions:

| id      | text                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------- |
| audio_1 | Hi                              |
| audio_2 | Madam, my name is Geeta Shankar |

<Note>
  All audio files should be in WAV format. The evaluation script expects files
  at `audios/<id>.wav` where `<id>` matches the `id` column in your CSV.
</Note>

Refer to the [sample dataset](https://github.com/ARTPARK-SAHAI-ORG/calibrate/tree/main/examples/stt/sample_input) for a template.

4. **Output directory** — where results will be saved (defaults to `./out`)
5. **API keys** — enter the API keys for the selected providers

The evaluation runs providers in parallel (max 2 at a time), showing the transcriptions as they are generated.

## Output

Once all the providers have completed, it displays a leaderboard measuring key metrics along with bar charts for better visualization.

You can also view the generated transcript and metrics for each row of your dataset including the LLM judge score and reasoning.
