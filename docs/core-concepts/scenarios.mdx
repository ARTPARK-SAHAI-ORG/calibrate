# Scenarios

Scenarios define the specific task or conversation goal for simulations. They describe WHAT the simulated user should do during the conversation, separate from WHO they are (which is defined by Personas).

## Overview

Scenarios are used in:
- End-to-end simulations
- Testing specific user journeys
- Evaluating agent handling of different requests

---

## Creating a Scenario

### Step 1: Navigate to Scenarios

From the sidebar, click **Scenarios** to view your existing scenarios.

### Step 2: Click "Add scenario"

Click the **Add scenario** button in the top right corner. A sidebar panel will open.

### Step 3: Configure the Scenario

#### Required Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Label** | Yes | A name for the scenario (e.g., "Crop Insurance Inquiry") |
| **Description** | Yes | What the simulated user should do during the conversation |

#### Description Guidelines

Define the task or goal clearly:

1. **State the objective**: What does the user want to achieve?
2. **Include specific details**: Names, numbers, products to ask about
3. **Set expectations**: What information should they request?

**Example Description:**

```text
Call to inquire about crop insurance schemes available for 
paddy farmers. Ask about the eligibility criteria, premium 
amounts, and the claim process. Request information about 
government subsidies for small-scale farmers in Karnataka.
```

<Note>
Avoid defining personality traits in scenarios. Use **Personas** to define HOW the simulated user behaves.
</Note>

### Step 4: Save the Scenario

Click **Add scenario** to create the scenario.

---

## Updating a Scenario

### Step 1: Open the Scenario

1. Navigate to **Scenarios** from the sidebar
2. Click on the scenario you want to edit
3. The edit sidebar will open with the current configuration

### Step 2: Modify Configuration

Update any of the following:

- **Label**: Change the scenario name
- **Description**: Update the task description

### Step 3: Save Changes

Click **Save** to apply your changes.

---

## Deleting a Scenario

<Warning>
Deleting a scenario will remove it from any simulations that reference it. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

### From the Scenarios List

1. Navigate to **Scenarios**
2. Find the scenario you want to delete
3. Click the **delete icon** (🗑️) on the right side
4. Confirm the deletion in the dialog

## Example Scenarios

### Insurance Inquiry

```text
Label: Crop Insurance Inquiry

Description:
Call to inquire about crop insurance schemes available for 
paddy farmers. Ask about the eligibility criteria, premium 
amounts, and the claim process. Request information about

```

### Account Balance Check

Provide your account number (1234567890) when asked. Also 
inquire about recent transactions in the last 7 days and 
ask about the minimum balance requirements.
```

### Product Return Request

```text
Label: Request Product Return

Description:
Call to request a return for a defective laptop purchased 
last week. Order number is ORD-2024-78945. Explain that the 
screen has dead pixels and the keyboard has a sticky key. 
Request a full refund rather than replacement.
```

### Appointment Scheduling

```text
Label: Schedule Doctor Appointment

Description:
Call to schedule an appointment with Dr. Sharma (General 
Physician). Preferred dates are next Monday or Tuesday, 
preferably in the morning before 11 AM. Mention that this 
is a follow-up visit for a previous consultation. Ask about 
any required documents to bring.
```

### Bill Payment Inquiry

```text
Label: Electricity Bill Payment

Description:
Call to inquire about your pending electricity bill. Consumer 
number is CON-456789. Ask about the due date, total amount, 
and available payment methods. Request information about any 
late payment penalties and ask if partial payment is allowed.

Request an estimated time for resolution and ask for a 
reference number for the complaint.
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Scenarios

1. **Be specific**: Include concrete details (order numbers, dates, amounts)
2. **Set clear objectives**: What should the user achieve?
3. **Include conversation flow hints**: What questions should they ask?
4. **Add realistic context**: Why is the user calling?

### Scenarios vs Personas

| Aspect | Scenario | Persona |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Focus | WHAT to do | WHO and HOW |
| Content | Task, goal, situation | Demographics, behavior |
| Example | "Call to get a refund for order #123" | "A busy professional who speaks quickly" |

### Scenario Complexity Levels

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Simple** | Single task, straightforward | "Check account balance" |
| **Medium** | Multiple questions, some details | "Inquire about insurance and ask about eligibility" |
| **Complex** | Edge cases, negotiations | "Dispute a charge and escalate if unsatisfied" |

### Testing Coverage

Create scenarios that cover:
- Common user journeys (happy path)
- Edge cases and unusual requests
- Complaint and escalation scenarios
- Multi-step processes

---

## Using Scenarios in Simulations

Scenarios are combined with Personas to run simulations. See the [Simulations guide](/guides/simulations) for details on:

- Creating simulation configurations
- Combining personas and scenarios
- Running and analyzing simulation results

**Example Combination:**

| Persona | Scenario | Test Case |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Rural Farmer | Crop Insurance Inquiry | Farmer asking about insurance in regional language |
| Busy Professional | Check Account Balance | Quick, efficient balance check |
| Elderly Customer | Schedule Appointment | Patient, detailed appointment scheduling |
