# Metrics

Metrics define how to evaluate whether a conversation was successful. They provide evaluation instructions for analyzing agent performance in simulations.

## Overview

Metrics are used to:
- Evaluate agent performance in simulations
- Define success criteria for conversations
- Track quality across different scenarios
- Compare agent effectiveness over time

---

## Creating a Metric

### Step 1: Navigate to Metrics

From the sidebar, click **Metrics** to view your existing metrics.

### Step 2: Click "Add metric"

Click the **Add metric** button in the top right corner. A sidebar panel will open.

### Step 3: Configure the Metric

#### Required Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Metric name** | Yes | A unique name for the metric (e.g., "Data Collection Success") |
| **Evaluation instructions** | No | How to evaluate if the conversation was successful |

<Note>
Metric names must be unique. You cannot create two metrics with the same name.
</Note>

#### Evaluation Instructions

Describe how the agent should evaluate success. Be specific about:

1. **What to check**: What conditions indicate success?
2. **Required outcomes**: What must happen for the metric to pass?
3. **Edge cases**: Any special considerations?

**Example Evaluation Instructions:**

```text
The agent should have collected the user's name and phone number 
during the conversation. 

Success criteria:
- Customer's full name was captured
- Phone number was captured in valid format (10 digits)
- Information was confirmed with the customer

The metric fails if:
- Either name or phone was not collected
- Information was not verified with the customer
```

### Step 4: Save the Metric

Click **Add metric** to create the metric.

---

## Updating a Metric

### Step 1: Open the Metric

1. Navigate to **Metrics** from the sidebar
2. Click on the metric you want to edit
3. The edit sidebar will open with the current configuration

### Step 2: Modify Configuration

Update any of the following:

- **Metric name**: Change the metric identifier (must remain unique)
- **Evaluation instructions**: Update the success criteria

### Step 3: Save Changes

Click **Save** to apply your changes.

---

## Duplicating a Metric

Create a copy of an existing metric to use as a starting point:

### Step 1: Find the Metric

1. Navigate to **Metrics** from the sidebar
2. Locate the metric you want to duplicate

### Step 2: Duplicate

1. Click the **duplicate icon** (📋) next to the metric
2. Enter a new unique name for the metric
3. Click **Duplicate**

The new metric will have the same evaluation instructions as the original. You can then edit it to modify the criteria.

---

## Deleting a Metric

<Warning>
Deleting a metric will remove it from any simulations that use it. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

### From the Metrics List

1. Navigate to **Metrics**
2. Find the metric you want to delete
3. Click the **delete icon** (🗑️) on the right side
4. Confirm the deletion in the dialog

## Metric Fields Reference

### Complete Field List

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| **Metric name** | Yes | string | Unique identifier for the metric |
| **Evaluation instructions** | No | string | Criteria for evaluating conversation success |

## Example Metrics

### Data Collection Success

```text
Name: Data Collection Success

Evaluation Instructions:
The agent should have collected the user's name and phone number 
during the conversation. 

Success criteria:
- Customer's full name was captured
- Phone number was captured in valid format
- Information was confirmed with the customer
```

### Issue Resolution

```text
Name: Issue Resolution

Evaluation Instructions:
The agent should have successfully resolved the customer's issue 
or clearly explained the next steps.

Success criteria:
- The customer's problem was clearly understood
- A solution was provided OR clear next steps were given
- The customer expressed satisfaction or understanding
- No escalation was required for a simple issue
```

### Appointment Booking

```text
Name: Appointment Booking

Evaluation Instructions:
The agent should have successfully booked an appointment with 
all required details.

Success criteria:
- Date and time were confirmed
- Patient/customer name was collected
- Purpose of appointment was noted
- Confirmation details were provided to the customer
```

### Product Information Delivery

```text
Name: Product Information Delivery

Evaluation Instructions:
The agent should have accurately provided the requested product 
information.

Success criteria:
- Correct product details were shared
- Pricing information was accurate
- Availability was confirmed
- Customer questions were fully answered
```

### Complaint Handling

```text
Name: Complaint Handling

Evaluation Instructions:
The agent should have handled the complaint professionally and 
provided appropriate resolution.

Success criteria:
- Complaint was acknowledged empathetically
- Issue details were captured accurately
- Reference/ticket number was provided
- Timeline for resolution was communicated
- Customer felt heard and respected
```

### Policy Explanation

```text
Name: Policy Explanation

Evaluation Instructions:
The agent should have clearly explained the relevant policy 
details to the customer.

Success criteria:
- Policy terms were explained in simple language
- Coverage/limitations were clearly stated
- Premium/cost information was provided if asked
- Customer questions were addressed completely
- No misleading or incorrect information was given
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Evaluation Instructions

1. **Be specific**: Define clear, measurable criteria
2. **List success conditions**: What must happen for success?
3. **List failure conditions**: What indicates failure?
4. **Consider partial success**: How to handle edge cases?

### Metric Categories

| Category | Focus | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Data Collection** | Information gathering | Name, phone, account details |
| **Task Completion** | Goal achievement | Booking, purchase, cancellation |
| **Quality** | Interaction quality | Politeness, accuracy, clarity |
| **Compliance** | Rule adherence | Disclosure, verification |

### Metric Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive names:

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| `Customer Data Collection` | `Data` |
| `Issue Resolution Rate` | `Resolution` |
| `Appointment Booking Success` | `Booking` |

### Combining Metrics

Use multiple metrics to evaluate different aspects:

```text
Simulation: Customer Support Call

Metrics:
1. Customer Identification - Was the customer verified?
2. Issue Understanding - Was the problem clearly captured?
3. Resolution Provided - Was a solution offered?
4. Follow-up Scheduled - Were next steps communicated?
```

## Using Metrics in Simulations

Metrics are attached to simulations to evaluate agent performance. See the [Simulations guide](/guides/simulations) for details on:

- Attaching metrics to simulations
- Viewing metric results
- Analyzing pass/fail rates
