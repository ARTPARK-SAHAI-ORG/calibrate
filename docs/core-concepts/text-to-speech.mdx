Text to Speech converts text to audio. Pense evaluates Text to Speech providers on **pronunciation quality** and **latency**.

## Quality Metrics

### LLM Judge Score

The LLM Judge listens to the generated audio and evaluates whether the pronunciation matches the input text.

- **Range**: 0 to 1 (1 means all audio correctly pronounces the text, higher is better)
- **Output**: Returns both a match (True/False) and reasoning for each audio file

**What LLM Judge evaluates:**
- Correct pronunciation of words
- Proper handling of numbers, abbreviations, and special characters
- Clarity and intelligibility

**Example Results:**

| Text | LLM Judge | Reasoning |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| "Hello world" | True | The audio clearly says "hello world" with correct pronunciation. |
| "Call 1-800-555-0123" | True | The phone number is pronounced correctly. |
| "Dr. Smith" | False | "Dr." was pronounced as "dur" instead of "doctor". |

## Latency Metrics

### Time to First Byte (TTFB)

Measures the time (in seconds) from when the synthesis request is made until the first audio chunk is received.

- **Importance**: Critical for real-time voice agents where responsiveness matters
- **Reported**: Mean, standard deviation, and per-item values

### Processing Time

Total time taken (in seconds) to synthesize the complete audio.

- **Importance**: Affects overall conversation latency
- **Reported**: Mean, standard deviation, and per-item values

## Output Files

### results.csv

Contains detailed results for each text:

| id | text | audio_path | llm_judge_score | llm_judge_reasoning |
|----|------|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| row_1 | hello world | ./out/audios/1.wav | True | The audio clearly says 'hello world'. |
| row_2 | this is a test | ./out/audios/2.wav | True | Clear pronunciation matching the input. |

### metrics.json

Contains aggregated metrics:

```json
[
  {"llm_judge_score": 1.0},
  {
    "metric_name": "ttfb",
    "processor": "GoogleTTSService#0",
    "mean": 0.35,
    "std": 0.03,
    "values": [0.38, 0.33, 0.34]
  },
  {
    "metric_name": "processing_time",
    "processor": "GoogleTTSService#0",
    "mean": 0.0002,
    "std": 0.00003,
    "values": [0.0002, 0.00025]
  }
]
```

### audios/

Generated audio files:
- `1.wav`, `2.wav`, etc.
- WAV format for easy playback and analysis

## Provider Considerations

Different providers have different strengths:

| Provider | Strengths |
|----------|-----------|
| Google | Good multilingual support, consistent quality |
| OpenAI | High quality neural voices |
| Cartesia | Very low latency, good for real-time |
| ElevenLabs | Premium voice quality, natural prosody |
| Sarvam | Excellent for Indian languages |
| Groq | Fast inference |
