Text to Speech converts text to audio. Pense evaluates Text to Speech providers on **pronunciation quality** and **latency**.

## Quality Metrics

### LLM Judge Score

The LLM Judge listens to the generated audio and evaluates whether the pronunciation matches the input text.

- **Range**: 0 to 1 (1 means all audio correctly pronounces the text, higher is better)
- **Output**: Returns both a match (True/False) and reasoning for each audio file

**What LLM Judge evaluates:**
- Correct pronunciation of words
- Proper handling of numbers, abbreviations, and special characters
- Clarity and intelligibility

**Example Results:**

| Text | LLM Judge | Reasoning |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| "Hello world" | True | The audio clearly says "hello world" with correct pronunciation. |
| "Call 1-800-555-0123" | True | The phone number is pronounced correctly. |
| "Dr. Smith" | False | "Dr." was pronounced as "dur" instead of "doctor". |

## Latency Metrics

### Time to First Byte (TTFB)

Measures the time (in seconds) from when the synthesis request is made until the first audio chunk is received.

- **Importance**: Critical for real-time voice agents where responsiveness matters
- **Reported**: Mean, standard deviation, and per-item values

## Output Files

### results.csv

Contains detailed results for each text:

| id | text | audio_path | ttfb | llm_judge_score | llm_judge_reasoning |
|----|------|------------|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| row_1 | hello world | ./out/elevenlabs/audios/row_1.wav | 1.511 | True | The audio says 'hello world' clearly and matches the reference text exactly. |
| row_2 | this is a test | ./out/elevenlabs/audios/row_2.wav | 1.215 | True | The audio clearly says 'this is a test,' which matches exactly with the provided reference text. |

### metrics.json

Contains aggregated metrics:

```json
{
  "llm_judge_score": 1.0,
  "ttfb": {
    "mean": 1.362950086593628,
    "std": 0.1476140022277832,
    "values": [1.5105640888214111, 1.2153360843658447]
  }
}
```

### audios/

Generated audio files:
- `row_1.wav`, `row_2.wav`, etc. (named after the `id` column in the input CSV)
- WAV format for easy playback and analysis

## Provider Considerations

Different providers have different strengths:

| Provider | Strengths |
|----------|-----------|
| Google | Good multilingual support, consistent quality |
| OpenAI | High quality neural voices |
| Cartesia | Very low latency, good for real-time |
| ElevenLabs | Premium voice quality, natural prosody |
| Sarvam | Excellent for Indian languages |
| Groq | Fast inference |
