## Metrics

### LLM Judge Score

An audio LLM Judge (`gpt-audio`) listens to the generated audio and evaluates whether the pronunciation matches the input text.

<Note>
  The LLM Judge directly compares the raw audio against the input text. It does
  **not** convert the generated speech to text first — it evaluates the audio
  natively using an audio-capable model.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Evaluation accuracy may differ for low-resource languages like Sindhi, as the
  underlying audio model has limited training data for these languages.
</Warning>

- **Range**: 0 to 1 (1 means all audio correctly pronounces the text, higher is better)
- **Output**: Returns both a match (True/False) and reasoning for each audio file

What the LLM Judge evaluates:

- Correct pronunciation of words
- Proper handling of numbers, abbreviations, and special characters

#### Example

| Text                  | Audio                                                              | LLM Judge | Reasoning                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Hello world"         | <audio controls src="/core-concepts/audios/hello_world.wav" />     | True      | The audio clearly says "hello world" with correct pronunciation. |
| "Call 1-800-555-0123" | <audio controls src="/core-concepts/audios/phone_number.wav" />    | True      | The phone number is pronounced correctly.                        |
| "Dr. Smith"           | <audio controls src="/core-concepts/audios/dr_smith.wav" />        | False     | "Dr." was pronounced as "dur" instead of "doctor".               |

### Time to First Byte (TTFB)

Measures the time (in seconds) from when the request is made to the provider until the first audio chunk is received. It is critical for real-time voice agents where responsiveness matters.
