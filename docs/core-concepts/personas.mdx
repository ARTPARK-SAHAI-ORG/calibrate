# Personas

Personas define the characteristics of simulated users that interact with your agents during testing. They determine WHO the simulated user is and HOW they behave during conversations.

## Overview

Personas are used in:
- End-to-end simulations
- Testing agent responses with different user types
- Evaluating agent performance across demographics

## Creating a Persona

### Step 1: Navigate to Personas

From the sidebar, click **Personas** to view your existing personas.

### Step 2: Click "Add persona"

Click the **Add persona** button in the top right corner. A sidebar panel will open.

### Step 3: Configure the Persona

#### Required Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Label** | Yes | A name for the persona (e.g., "Rural Farmer - Karnataka") |
| **Characteristics** | Yes | Detailed description of WHO the persona is and HOW they behave |

#### Characteristics Guidelines

Define two key aspects:

1. **WHO**: Specific details about the persona
   - Name, age, occupation
   - Location, background
   - Language proficiency

2. **HOW**: Behavioral traits
   - Communication style (polite, impatient, formal)
   - Speech patterns (slow, uses filler words)
   - Temperament (calm, easily frustrated)

**Example Characteristics:**

```text
You are Rajesh, a 45-year-old farmer from rural Karnataka who 
speaks primarily in Kannada with limited English proficiency. 

You are polite and friendly but speak slowly with natural 
pauses like "uhh" and "umm". You have a calm and patient 
demeanor but can become frustrated when technical jargon is used. 

You prefer simple, straightforward explanations and often ask 
for clarification. You tend to repeat important information 
to make sure you understood correctly.
```

<Note>
Avoid including task instructions in characteristics. Use **Scenarios** to define WHAT the persona should do.
</Note>

### Step 4: Configure Voice Settings

#### Gender

Select the voice gender for the simulated user:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Male** | Male voice synthesis |
| **Female** | Female voice synthesis |

#### Language

Select the primary language for the persona:

| Language | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **English** | English voice and speech patterns |
| **Hindi** | Hindi voice and speech patterns |
| **Kannada** | Kannada voice and speech patterns |

#### Interruption Sensitivity

Real users often interrupt agents mid-sentence. Configure how likely this persona is to interrupt:

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **None** | Persona never interrupts |
| **Low** | 25% chance of interrupting |
| **Medium** | 50% chance of interrupting |
| **High** | 80% chance of interrupting |

### Step 5: Save the Persona

Click **Add persona** to create the persona.
